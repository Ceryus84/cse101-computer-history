% Since acm has been around a wee bit longer than the internet, and therefore internet
% citations, I have included an example of a citation for an internet source that 
% includes a url link to the article accessed, as well as the date that article was 
% accessed by you.
% The title line uses the following format:
% title = {\href{url}{title of article}}
% The line year = {August 17, 2021 (accessed: 09-16-2021)} can be broken down as 
% follows: August 17 2021 = date article written; accessed: 09-16-2021 = date article 
% was accessed by you.
